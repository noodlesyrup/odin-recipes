          <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Furikake Rice </strong>first made its debut in episode 2 of
            Food Wars. Although it is only made of rice, scrambled eggs,
            chicken, and green onions, this simple dish relies on a secret
            ingredient to make it special: gelatin cubes. This recipe is a tad
            difficult if you have little cooking experience, but it gets easier
            after you've prepared the chicken broth.
